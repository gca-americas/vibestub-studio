# The built page is not in git, so a pull brings new sources and leaves the old
# build in place. scripts/start.sh compares the two and rebuilds when needed,
# which is why a restart is all this has to do.

# number outlives the process it named, and a wrapper killed outright leaves the
# real server running under a pid nobody wrote down. Nothing is killed that does
# not look like this repo's server and run from this directory, and never this
# shell or one of its ancestors.
